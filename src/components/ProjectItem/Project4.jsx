          <h6 className="project-article__title">Project Objective</h6>
          <p>
            Each new employee encountered the issue of receiving disjointed
            items without a unified concept. Our goal was to create an
            integrated and meaningful welcome-pack that reflects Yandex's brand
            platform and demonstrates the company's care for its employees from
            their first day at work.

          <h6 className="project-article__title">Conceptual Solution</h6>
          <p>
            We developed a unified merch concept where each element of the new
            employee's package was closely linked with others, forming a
            cohesive whole. This symbolises Yandex's key ideaâ€”collaborating,
            seeking new solutions, and creating together.
          </p>
          <h6 className="project-article__title">Core Idea</h6>
          <p>
            We created a system where each element of the welcome-pack can be
            connected to others using various attachment elements. This not only
            physically unites the items but also serves as a metaphor for
            teamwork at Yandex.

            The contents of the bag were planned based on feedback from new

          <p>
            First impressions are crucial. Yandex's welcome-pack is designed to
            reflect the corporate values and culture of the company, as well as
            to provide new employees with the necessary tools for successful
            integration into the team from day one.
